### Customizable Filters
Filter values are preloaded with values for tritanopia, deuteranopia, and protanopia. These can be used on their own or customized and combined to create a filter that works best for you. After selecting your filter values using the sliders click _Confirm_. You can test your filter values by selecting the _Test Filter_ button in the menu on the right. You can choose _Reset Sliders_ to clear the filter values and start from scratch. Once you have the filter how you want it, you can save the filter by clicking _Save Filter_. 

Once you have a saved filter you can recall it from the dropdown menu in the filter selection area and click _Confirm_ to use it any time you use Roy G. Biv!

### Screen Filtering
Once you have selected and confirmed your filter, you can choose to filter your screen by clicking the _Filter Your Screen_ button from the menu on the right. From here you can choose whether to filter your whole screen or a specific range of your screen. 

For a full screen filter, simply click the _Full screen Filter_ checkbox and a picture will be generated of your whole screen with the selected filter applied and displayed on the screen.

For a range filter, click the _Range Selection Filter_ checkbox and a semi-transparent range selection box will appear on the screen. Manipulate the size and position of the range selection box to your desired range and click the _Select Range_ button at the top of the range selection box. An image of the selected range with the selected filter applied will be generated and displayed on the screen.

### Image Filtering
To filter an image, click _Filter a Photo_ from the menu on the right. A screen will appear to browse files. Click _Browse Files_ and select the image you would like to filter. The image will appear on the screen, along with its file name at the bottom. Your selected filter values will be shown at the bottom of the screen as well. Click the _Apply Filter_ button and a new image will be generated with the desired filter applied to the selected photo.

### Color Detection
To detect the color(s) of a range of the screen, select the _Detect Color_ button from the menu on the right. A color detection screen will appear with instructions, the current status of color detection, and an area to see the color breakdown on the right. Click _Breakdown_ and select a range by manipulating the size and position of the range selection box and click _Select Range_ when finished. Roy G. Biv will then begin detecting the color(s) of the selected area.

**_WARNING: Do not interact with any Roy G. Biv windows while the color is being detected (or has a status of Running)_**

Once the program is done detecting the color(s) of the range you will be able to see the breakdown printed on the right. It will show the count colors based on pixel and the percentage of each color within the range.
